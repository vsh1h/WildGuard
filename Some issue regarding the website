Some issues I found while browsing your website :-

-In the 4 topics on the home page there should be Save water instead of Safe water.
-There should be buttons for the topics on the home page which direct the user to the content regarding them.
-The login and register buttons should be in-line with other buttons or evidently bigger than others and highlighted to make it more symmetric.
-On the home page ,there should not be '~' sign before the welcome sentence.
-In the support us with our donation section, there should be some explanation regarding the Basic tier donation so that it becomes more reliable and easier for the user.
-In the section such as Save nature(Read More), etc. section, there should be use of more graphical images, animations so that it becomes more interactive and self explanatory instead of just texts.Images would be much better than just texts to make it easier for the user. 
-The icons for the social media would be better if larger and coloured.
-There should borders and colors around the forum and the Discussions tab should be enabled.
